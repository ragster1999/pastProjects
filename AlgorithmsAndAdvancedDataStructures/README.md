In this project I was tasked to submit a program for testing on the webite Kattis.

Kattis is a site through which developers can solve complex problems and have their code submitted for testing and efficiency.

I was tasked with submitting a solution for the problem in the link below:

https://open.kattis.com/problems/wheresmyinternet 

If you so choose, you can also test my code! Simply download the two .java files in this repo and submit them to the website above after clicking on the "submit" icon.
