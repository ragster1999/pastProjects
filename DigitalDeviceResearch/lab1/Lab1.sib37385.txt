Part 4 Attempt

Some comments on this attempt: We put in a good amount of trying to get this to function
correctly but came up just a little short. Our biggest problems came on the side
of the server, but we also had some problems with the client as well. The server side
of things, we struggled with the char buff[BUFFSIZE] syntax and what to do with that, 
at well as struggled with successfully keeping our while loop checking for other 
clients to join running long enough to work, as well as some minor fork() syntax as well. 
On the client side, we struggle with the input printing without having to hit the enter/ 
return key to get it to show up. The output below is output that is only printed after
the client has hit the return key. Another struggle was our schedules not aligning 
up the way they needed to for an even more adequate amount of time to work on the 
challenge.
