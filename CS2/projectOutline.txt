COS212 Final Project Outline

1) How do I run it in debug mode?
  Press the “debug mode” button. You should see the other buttons change color. Then submit the code you’d like to use for debugging just like you would a normal code, then press “Submit”. The buttons should then change back to their original colors and the game will be ready to play.
 
2) How did you implement the method to randomly generate the secret code?
  I created a random loop named “generateRandomColor()” that used the length of the char array of viable colors. I used that length as the range in a random integer generator that returned a random integer that I then set as the index for that array of viable chars (which correspond to the choosable colors) which was passed back as the index to choose from.
 
3) How did you implement the method to count the number of black/white pegs
  I first created the count black method, checking each index and color in my two arrays, the guess array containing the user’s guess, and the key containing the correct sequence of colors. Then for counting the whites, I used a nested loop, taking one of the elements from the key and searching for it in the player’s guess, breaking once it was found to take care of duplicates. After the loop, I then subtract the number of blacks from that total, and return the number of whites.
 
4) What is one thing you learned?
  How to use GUI’s, since I didn’t take CS1. Also, a lot about implementing front end, since all my experience is in back and system administration in for Unix systems, so this was a good change of pace!
 
5) What was the most challenging part of the project?
  Definitely, the GUI, since I haven’t had any experience with GUI’s at all.
 
6) What are you doing for Christmas break?
  Recording a lot of music and playing some gigs, also watching a lot of StarWars. I also thought I’d try this whole sleep thing everyone has been talking about, seems interesting.
